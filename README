Brush â€” the Bourne RUby SHell (though not *yet* Bourne compatible)

Brush is intended to be an interactive shell with the power of Ruby.  As
it is in its infancy, it is very basic and much of the functionality is
implemented by scaffolding that will later be replaced.  For instance,
presently commands are passed off to another shell for execution, but
eventually all globing, pipe setup, forking, and execing will be handled
directly by Brush.

By default commands are executed as they are given.  To invoke the Ruby
REPL (read-eval-print loop) just begin any line with whitespace.  All
commands and REPL input is restricted to a single line for now until the
command and REPL parsers are hooked in.  The command parser will be part
of Brush and the REPL parser will probably use IRB.

Alternatively, Brush can be licensed by the same terms as Ruby, but it
may not be dual-licensed when redistributed.  You must select the BSD
license or the Ruby license and specify which terms the software is
henceforth licensed by.
